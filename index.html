<p> Your whole life is on your phone - your memories, your travel plans, your loved ones’ information. To lose your phone to a careless slip of your hand is unacceptable. And with the innovative Hummingbird flight system, your worries can float away. 
Perfect for the perpetually clumsy and for those who just want some extra security, Hummingbird keeps your phone exactly where you want it. 
Our innovative system allows you to select Portrait or Landscape hover modes, with the emergency monitor ensuring that your phone never touches the ground - unless you put it there!
Hummingbird can lead the way as you walk down the street or even through your house, thanks to our flight motion technology. </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Technical Explanation</h3>

<p>Our state of the art multirotor cellular phone flight system uses the best-in-class accelerometer and feather-light carbon graphene rotor technology to effectively sustain flight for up to 25 minutes. 
Our aftermarket solutions are battle-tested in the most rigorous environments, and we hold our manufacturers to the highest standard.
Our accelerometer that detects when the phone enters free-fall is the same technology that multiple militaries teams use for their UAV and semi-autonomous drone needs. The gyroscopic stabilizer effortlessly rights the phone during free-fall, and maintains a stable heading and orientation in every scenario. 
We’ve assembled the best industrial designers from JPL, NASA, Apple, and IKEA, who have constructed lightweight, effective, and flexible inconel titanium alloy rotor wings that weigh less than 1.2 grams, and are sturdy enough to cut through belligerent human flesh with ease. 
Our 2.6 K motor is one of the most power-efficient yet powerful on the market, producing over 500 grams of thrust per propeller. 
The combination of the powerful motors, durable yet lightweight rotors, and expertly-made chassis mean that your Hummingbird flight system will maintain height and speed in the harshest wind, cold, or rain. The carefully-constructed carbon-fiber housing protects the internal components from sand, snow, or other particulates. .</p>
